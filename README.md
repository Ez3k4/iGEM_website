# Intermediate solution for iGEM 2024 Wiki

To build the wiki locally, use hugo
```
hugo server
```
This will host a local instance of the website and you can make changes which are rendered in realtime!
Remember that for "bigger" changes such as menus and overall layout, it may be required to restart this process.
